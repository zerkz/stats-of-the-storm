          <h3 class="ui inverted dividing header">Version 2.0.1</h3>
          <p>
            Hotfix: replay import list properly clears.
          </p>
          <h3 class="ui inverted dividing header">Version 2.0.0</h3>
          <p>
            2.0 so soon? It's all due to a change to the database format that Stats of the Storm uses.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this update, databases will no longer have a maximum size limit and the application
            will use less memory for larger databases. This comes with a tradeoff of slower database queries,
            however as databases can grow without bound, it seems like an ok one to make. As always, if you run into
            bugs or problems, send in a bug report. The database conversion operation is non-destructive, so
            don't panic if something goes wrong!
          </p>
          <p>
            App: Parser update to version 5. This contains updates related to the new database format, and adds
            two additional flags for future use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bugfix: Import sets and collections format error correction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Matches: now shows 20 matches at a time.

            Settings: <a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/146">#146</a> Added Import Sets. Can set
            folders to be imported to one or more collections automatically. Import sets are set per-database and are stored

          <h3 class="ui inverted dividing header">Version 0.6.0</h3>
          <p>
            Version 0.6.0 brings the ability to export PDF reports for most sections of the application.
            The feature snapshots the current section that you're looking at, so you'll have to set your tables to
            the proper sort order before printing (the exporter does not assume how you want your tables sorted).
          </p>
          <p>
            When using this feature, please
            note that the paper size will vary between Letter and Legal in order to fit all of the information on the page. Note also
            that the app will briefly change appearance while the print process completes.

          <p>
            macOS: <a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/135">#135</a> Build server should now properly re-fetch available parsing protocols.
          </p>

          <p>
            App: Numbers are now formatted to have commas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Matches: The option to delete an individual match or selected matches has been added under the "File"
            menu on the Matches and Match Details pages. Additionally, the "Export" menu has been renamed to "File" for those pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bugfix: <a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/133">#133</a> The database migration to version
            3 will now continue processing matches even if one of them throws an exception during processing. This bug
            only occasionally affected users migrating from version 2 to version 3.
          </p>
          <p>
            macOS: The app is now signed with a development license, and the auto-update might start working. We'll see in the next version

            The fix for this requires an optional re-import to restore this functionality. Player Details and most other sections are unaffected by this bug.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bugfix: <a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/130">#130</a> Parser now properly identifies the same
            match recorded on different computers.
          </p>
          <h3 class="ui inverted dividing header">Version 0.5.0</h3>
          <p>
            Version 0.5.0 brings overall map stats, team composition stats,
            and external database comparison support to Stats of the Storm. This version also corrects the match lengths
            in the database. You do not need to re-import your matches to get the extra stats in this version.
            <br>
            Thanks again to AlexNewell on GitHub for finding some bugs this time around.
          </p>
          <p>
            Version 0.5.0 is also the first version of Stats of the Storm available on Mac. This app
            should be considered experimental on macOS, as I have only been able to test on a VM.
            Let me know what problems you encounter with the app on macOS!
          </p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/120">#120</a>

            New Feature: Team Compositions. See win rate and popularity for team compositions in the Hero Details
            page, and see how those compositions change over time in the Trends page.

          <p><a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/124">#124</a>
            Parser: Corrected match lengths. Note that the graphs still extend past the match end. This is due
            to the last XP breakdown occuring after the game technically ends. For completeness, I have let the graphs
            extend to this duration instead of clamping them.
          </p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/122">#122</a>

            Talent Descriptions: Updated heroes-talents to handle changes in most recent build 63070.

          <p>Parser update for build 63070.</p>
          <h3 class="ui inverted dividing header">Version 0.3.0</h3>
          <p>
            Version 0.3.0 fixes a few bugs, adds additional data views for players and teams, lets you parse replays from
            any language, and also allows you to
            compare player and team performance to the overall collection averages. Data for players and matches can
            now be exported in json format from the UI. If you have additional data you'd like to see in those exports,
            let me know what you'd like to see.
          </p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/85">#85</a>

          <p>Parser: Switch heroprotocol libraries to <a href="https://github.com/nydus/heroprotocol">nydus/heroprotocol</a>. Parser is way faster.</p>
          <p>App: Dev tools accessible from Settings menu.</p>
          <h3 class="ui inverted dividing header">Version 0.2.3</h3>
          <p>Parser: Corrected an issue where the path to the parser executable was accidentally left on dev settings.</p>
          <h3 class="ui inverted dividing header">Version 0.2.2</h3>
          <p>Match Details: Corrected an issue for Braxis Holdout, where beacons would spawn but the game would end before a wave would spawn, causing a crash in the timeline view</p>
          <h3 class="ui inverted dividing header">Version 0.2.1</h3>
          <p>Draft Stats: hotfix for pre-2.0 (client version 2.25.0) replays missing draft pick and ban data.</p>
          <p>Correctly applied player game threshold to Player Details with/against player tables.</p>
          <h3 class="ui inverted dividing header">Version 0.2.0</h3>
          <p>
            Version 0.2.0 brings talent builds and the full draft data to Stats of the Storm, along
            with a few changes that improve the general performance of the app. Since the draft data is contained
            in the replay file itself, you'll have to re-import your replays to use the new features. Unfortunately you'll
            have to do that any time the parser backend changes, so I'll try to keep those changes to a minimum.
          </p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/92">#92</a> Parser: Added draft order. Parser is now at Version 2. Note: To use this feature you have to re-import your matches. Pick order stats are now shown on team summary pages and the Collection Stats: Heroes page. Thanks to /u/SlapJack1337 on Reddit for showing me where this data is.</p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/93">#93</a> Allow re-import of duplicate</p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/87">#87</a> Match Details: Shows time per talent tier for each team. Additionally, team summaries show average time per talent tier.</p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/59">#59</a> Heroes: Added build stats, which display talent combinations and win rates. Available on Player summary pages and overall hero stat pages.</p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/88">#88</a> App: Any menu that lets you select a player now has a threshold of required matches in the database. This improves the general performance of the app. This is adjustable in settings.</p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/91">#91</a> Collection Stats: Players: Changing the focued hero data requires users to click the search button in the filters tab. Accidentally changing that menu's values could lead to an app hang with large databases.</p>
          <h3 class="ui inverted dividing header">Version 0.1.2</h3>
          <p>Parser: Corrected an issue where kills were incorrectly attributed to "Nexus Forces" (and also corrected an occasional crash).</p>
          <h3 class="ui inverted dividing header">Version 0.1.1</h3>
          <p>Teams: Corrected issue where players could not be added to teams with the Add Player button.</p>

              Passive XP % Gain is the percentage of passive exp earned above the baseline.
              So as an example, if your team averaged 25 XP/s, your passive XP gain would be +25%.
              Passive XP Gain is the absolute amount of XP gained over the baseline during a match.
